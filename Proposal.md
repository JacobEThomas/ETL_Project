# Proposal

This project will EXTRACT target data from two sources:
(1) an existing dataset, proprietary to the University of Texas, containing mental health and substance use data of >5000 Young Adult Texans and >12.5M datapoints which was sampled every 6 months from 2015.
(2) the US Census Bureau API targeting the American Community Survey.

I am interested in TRANSFORMING the data to include mental health outcomes from the UT dataset, and pairing the data with poverty and crime rates at the zip code level. From here future analyses could examine the association of poverty and crime rates in community one lives in with mental health.

This new dataset will me LOADED as a csv and into a PostgreSQL database to facilitate statistical modeling and queries.
